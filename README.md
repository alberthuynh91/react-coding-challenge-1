This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React Coding Challenge

Clone down the repo and start the app by running `npm start`. Hot reloading is enabled so you will see  live updates in localhost when you make changes to your code.

### Instructions

Create a React class component (in a new seperate file, within the `/src` directory) that does the following
1) Makes an call to an API to get some data. Take the data that is returned from the call and save it in state.
2) Utilize a react lifecycle
3) Render the data on the page
4) Create another component inside the class component (ex. Button component) that can run an action that modifies some state
5) Render this newly created class component inside of the `src/App.js` file. Remove all of the original contents between the `<header>` and `</header>` and insert your component there.
