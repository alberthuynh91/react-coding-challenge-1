This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React Coding Challenge

Clone down the repo and start the app by running `npm start`. Hot reloading is enabled so you will see  live updates in localhost when you make changes to your code. This coding challenge ideally should only take 1-2 hours max.

### Instructions

Create a React class component (in a new seperate file, within the `/src` directory) that does the following
1) Make a call to an API to get some data. Take the data that is returned from the call and save it in state. If you are unable to find an api you like, you are welcome to use this sample dog api which returns random images of dogs (https://random.dog/woof.json)
2) Utilize a react lifecycle (ex. componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount)
3) Render the data from the API on the page
4) Create another component inside the class component (ex. Button component) that can run an action that modifies the state
5) Render this newly created class component inside of the `src/App.js` file. Remove all of the original contents between the `<header>` and `</header>` and insert your component there.
